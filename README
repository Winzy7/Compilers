1. Explain design decisions, explain why your code is correct, and why
    your test cases are adequate.

	The ovearching design was breaking everything from something big to something smaller. There will be multiple things encasing others and ensuring the smaller rules were right, like the singular feature or formal was right, would make sure the other bigger rules (like for a method's parameters or multiple attributes/methods in a class) are correctly recognized. So in making sure to adhere to the manual and the syntax of the language and developing the rules in respect to that, it culminates into a full class also works.

	Our test cases are accurate as we just went through each different case one by one, like deleting a parameter randomly to have a method start with a comma or having mismatched parentheses/curly braces. This ensures we cover a wide variety of cases.
