README file for Programming Assignment 3 (C++ edition)
======================================================

	The Makefile contains targets for compiling and running your
	program. DO NOT MODIFY.
    
	The README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to
	fill in the README with the write-up for your project. You should
	explain design decisions, explain why your code is correct, and why
	your test cases are adequate. It is part of the assignment to
	clearly and concisely explain things in text as well as to comment
	your code. Just edit this file.

	cool.y is the skeleton for the parser specification that you
	are to write. It already contains productions for the program
	and the classes. Use them as an example to write the remaining
	productions.  You should also read the bison documentation.
	This skeleton will compile and run as is, but it doesn't
	do much.

	good.cl, bad.cl test a few features of the grammar. You should
	add tests to ensure that good.cl exercises every legal
	construction of the grammar and that bad.cl exercises as many
	different parsing errors as you can squeeze into one file.

    Do not modify any other file.

Instructions
------------

	To compile your parser program type:

	% make

	This produces an executable named "parser" which is standalone
	phase of the Cool compiler. The parser executable accepts
    as input the output of the lexer phase, so in order to test it,
    you'll need to copy a lexer into the directory: either your
    own lexer from the previous assignment, or the lexer from the
    reference implementation of the compiler.

	To run your parser on the files good.cl and bad.cl type:

	% make dotest

    If you think your parser is correct and behaves like
    the one we wrote, you can try it out by replacing the parser
    in the reference compiler with your own lexer. Just copy
    your compiled parser binary from this assignment into the
    directory where the reference compiler is.

    To submit your solution, run:

    % make zip

    Check the resulting zip file to make sure it contains everything
    it should. Then submit it on Gradescope.

	GOOD LUCK!
